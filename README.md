## SPACE X WEBSITE
In this project I made the clone of spaceX which is much similar to original site.I added the transistions and animations to the text and images to make the site look good. I used HTML and CSS for all the stlying and JavaScript to add functionality.

## Things Learnt
I learnt how to make animations using the keyframes like fade, slideUp, Bounce, etc. I made this using Vanilla CSS. I learnt how to use JavaScript for making the stats display and how to callback the nested functions in a function. I also used a bit of asynchronous js in this project to call a function after certain amount of time. I learnt a lot and loved making this project. This project idea is of Brad Travery on youtue. He made me learn many new things. Thank You.
